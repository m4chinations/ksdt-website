This fall edition of CRSSD Fest goes to show that this sweet San Diego music festival is only ripening with age!  CRSSD is coming into its own, while breaking all the rules. With headliners like the Flaming Lips and TV on the Radio set to rock out the main stage, CRSSD is no longer defined by just one genre it is simply good music at the heart. CRSSD is situated once again on the beautiful Waterfront Park in Downtown San Diego; supporting the community by promoting local vendors, while showcasing world-class music. This second installment of CRSSD Fest is a must for any San Diegan.
